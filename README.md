First Assignment for Object Oriented Programming.

This program is designed to compare the stock prices over the last 90 days for 3 public trading companies of an industry. 

When the user launches the program there is an instruction line which indicates the option the user has when navigating through the program as seen below.

If the user were to select option 0 (through pressing 0 on the keyboard) a graph with 3 trend lines comparing each company appears. If the user were to run their mouse across the graph, a value(closing stock price) will appear along side the date relative to the value. As displayed below.

With this, the user can select an option between 1 and 3 where they view the individual graphs for each company. Each individual company graph is illustrated on its own and as with the graph in option 0, if the user were to run their mouse across the graph, a value will appear along side the date relative to the value.

With this in mind, the user can then view the data in a rotating 3D bar chart. As the user moves their mouse across the screen the wheel rotates. The bars are color coded, the lighter bars have a higher value while the darker bars have a lower one.

First Assignment for Object Oriented Programming.

This program loads 4 separate files containing the stock information from the last 3 months for 3 different public trading companies. It then allows the user to compare all 3 companies, or when each trend line is individually clicked it will display that particular trend graph alone. 0 will be the return key to return to the default graph which is the 3 companies together.

With that in mind, when the mouse goes over the graph[s], the price for said stock is displayed alongside the date.
